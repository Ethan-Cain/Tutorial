# Basic Hexadecimal Arithmetic Lesson 1 - Learn to add hexadecimal numbers!
### Ethan Cain
##### The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how one can add hexadecimal numbers. A small introduction to hexadecimal then onto adding numbers with examples. Rather than just converting the numbers to binary then adding then converting the answer back, one can learn how to add hexadecimals together to save time and learn a new skill!

##### The ideal target audience would be someone with at least a rudimentary knowledge of hexadecimal who is still unfamiliar with how to add them together. We learned about adding binary, but not hexadecimal so I thought I'd teach myself and make a tutorial on what I've learned.

# Basic Hexadecimal Arithmetic Lesson 1 - Learn to add hexadecimal numbers!
### Ethan Cain
##### The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how one can add hexadecimal numbers. A small introduction to hexadecimal then onto adding numbers with examples.
##### The ideal target audience would be someone with at least a rudimentary knowledge of hexadecimal who is still unfamiliar with how to add them together. We learned about adding binary, but not hexadecimal so I thought I'd teach myself and make a tutorial on what I've learned.

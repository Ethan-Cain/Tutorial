# Basic Hexadecimal Arithmetic - Learn to add and subtract hexadecimal numbers!
### Ethan Cain
##### The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how one can add and subtract hexadecimal numbers. A small introduction to hexadecimal then onto adding numbers with plenty of examples then subtracting with examples.
##### The ideal target audience would be someone with at least a rudimentary knowledge of hexadecimal who is still unfamiliar with how to add or subtract them. We learned about adding and subtracting binary, but not hexadecimal so I thought I'd teach myself and make a tutorial on what I've learned.

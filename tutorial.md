# Adding Hexadecimal Numbers

[If you are unfamiliar with what hexadecimal is go and learn about the basics here then come back to learn addition and subtraction!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)

### Addition

To begin with, I'm going to create a table I've seen that is extremely helpful for doing the following addition examples. 

 add | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F
 --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F
 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10
 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11
 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12
 4 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13
 5 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14
 6 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15
 7 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16
 8 | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17
 9 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18
 A | A | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19
 B | B | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A
 C | C | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B
 D | D | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B | 1C
 E | E | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B | 1C | 1D
 F | F | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 1A | 1B | 1C | 1D | 1E

Walkthrough example 1

2418 + 43B = ?

* The first step is to start just how one would with decimal addition - adding together the right-most digits of each number, in this case 8 + B. If we consult our list, we see that this is 13.

* Next, we move on to adding the next two right-most digits of each number 1 + 3, BUT remember, just like with decimal addition, you must carry the 1 that we have left over from our previous 13. So, it is 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.

* Now, we continue on to the next right-most digits of each number A + 4. Consulting our chart we see this is E and since there is no 1 to carry, we can move on.

* Again, go to the next rightmost number(s) in this case it is just a 2, so just carry the two down to your result. Setting all out found numbers next to each other we find that 2A18 + 43B = 2E53. Not too difficult when given the chart!
